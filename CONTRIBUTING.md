# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions to this repo are free, open-source, and follow the process outlined below:

Any ES-Standards document can be referred to interchangeably as an "ES", "Evernode Standard", or "document".

## Summary

Copyright on all content is subject to the terms of the [license](LICENSE).

All contributors grant everyone:

Copyright: a royalty-free license to use the copyrights for their contributions.
Patent: a commitment to license on a royalty-free basis their essential patent claims reading on their contributions.

## Background

The work of the Evernode community is open source, collaborative, and welcoming of all contributors participating in good faith.

## Process

The ES-Standards process attempts to be easy to use, but also rigorous enough that there are permalinks to revisions of documents for reference purposes.

### Gathering Feedback Before Submitting

Please gather community input before opening a PR. Collecting such feedback helps to refine your concept. This step is required.

Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/Evernerd/Evernode-Standards/discussions) under this repo.

The title should follow the naming convention `ES-0000d {Title}`, where `0000` is a unique number for the ES, `d` indicates that the document is a Draft (in progress), and `{Title}` is a descriptive title for the proposed document.

Use the next number that has not yet been used. If a conflict occurs, it will be fixed by a maintainer or editor. Maintainers or editors also reserve the right to remove or re-number proposals as necessary.

The number is important, as it will be used to reference features and ideas throughout the community.

Discussions are suitable for early work-in-progress: ask, suggest, add, and make sweeping changes.

When a discussion has produced a well-refined standard, authors should post a comment to the discussion noting that it will be closed in a few days. This allows time (for those engaged with the discussion) to submit any final commentary. 

When the fair notice time has elapsed, the author should move from discussion to Draft by opening a PULL REQUEST.


The standard's author must edit and replace the post with a summary and a link to the PR.

The last comment on the discussion should also be a link to the PR.

Finally, the discussion should be closed from further comments, with further comments instead being posted on the PR for fine-tuning and alignment with implementation or adoption (as appropriate).

When opening a PR, there are two document types: *Drafts* and *Candidate Specifications*. The type and status of any particular document has no bearing on the priority of that document. Typically, the further along in the process, the more likely it is that any particular ES will be implemented or adopted.

### Drafts

A _Draft_ is a document that proposes some new feature, protocol or idea related to the Evernode. The criteria for getting the document merged is minimal: project maintainers will review the document to ensure style conformance and applicability, but will otherwise not require editorial fixes before allowing it to be published.

A document does not need to have an implementation in order to become a Draft. A Draft may or may not have implementation(s) available; no code is required prior to the Draft being published.
A Draft is often stable enough for people to experiment with, but has not necessarily been endorsed by the entire community. When there are competing Drafts that address the same problem in different ways, all such Drafts can continue to be refined, promoted, and used independently, without any blocking. Implementors can create software to implement this type of standard into their codebase to explore how it works in a real world setting.

Any, or all, competing Drafts may graduate into a Candidate Specification.

Notice that a Draft is not a [rubber-stamp](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/rubber-stamp) of the content in any particular document. Documents can still undergo significant changes and potentially be discarded all together.

#### Publishing a Draft

To publish a new Draft, submit a Pull Request to this repo with a new folder and a new Markdown file. The folder MUST follow the naming convention `ES-0000d-{title}`, `0000` is the unique number referencing the ES, `d` indicates that the document is a Draft, and `title` is a lower case title with spaces replaced by hyphens (`-`). The submission should have front-matter (similar to GitHub pages rendered from Markdown) specifying at least a `title` and `type`. The `type` MUST have the value `draft`.

Use the following template when creating the Markdown file: [es-template.md](./es-template.md)

Assuming there is consensus to publish, one of the project maintainers will review the submission and confirm the document's ES number, often making a follow-up commit to the PR which renames the file as appropriate.

### Candidate Specifications

A _Candidate Specification_ is a document that was previously a Draft that is considered stable enough by the community such that no further changes are required. Once an ES becomes a Candidate Specification, no further substantive changes are allowed under the same ES number.

#### Publishing a Candidate Specification

When a Draft is considered stable, there is a call for review from the community to publish the document as a Candidate Specification by making a PR to remove the `d` from the document folder name and update the `type` to `candidate-specification`.


Once published as a Candidate Specification, no further substantive changes are allowed under the same ES number.

For Specifications that require changes or implementation in the HotPocket, Sashimono, Evernode Host server software and protocol, the Candidate Specification cannot be published until the relevant change has been merged into the software's `master` branch.

#### Errata

The community may discover errors in a Candidate Specification. In these circumstances, it is possible to update the document to fix typos or clarify the original meaning of the document.

### Deprecated or Rejected ES's

An ES document may be rejected after public discussion has settled and comments have been made summarizing the rationale for rejection. Similarly, a document may be deprecated when its use should be discouraged. A member of the core maintainer team will move rejected and deprecated proposals to the `/rejected` folder in this repo.
