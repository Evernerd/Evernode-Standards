# Directory

When a standard moves to a folder + file(s) in the Code section of this repository, it should be added to the `standards.toml` file:
https://github.com/Evernerd/Evernerd-Standards/blob/master/standards.toml

# Numbering

Standards must be numbered and referenced in the following format: EVS-# where # is a natural number (without left padded zeros), called the __Standard Number__.

# Revisions

If a standard requires a substantive revision and using the same number would result in confusion, a separator '.' may be added, e.g. `EVS-1.1`.

# Drafts

A standard which has not yet been adopted may 'hold' a Standard Number but must be referred to with a __d__ suffix until it becomes a full standard, e.g. `EVS-3d` or `EVS-1.2d`.
